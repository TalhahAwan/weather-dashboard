# weather-dashboard

## Description

I was motivated to complete this project to gain a larger understanding on how to make webpages work through vanilla JS.
I built this project to deliver the client a dashboard that displays the weather.
Created a webpage from the ground up to deliver to the client.
I learned better JS coding.

2. Open in VS code.
3. Right click the index.html and open it in your default browser.
4. You should now be able to view the page.
